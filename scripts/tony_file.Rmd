# Innovative School Practices   
## Importing the Data  

Thank you Janette for compiling the data!

```{r import}

load(here("data/canopy-schools.RData"))


```

*After looking at the data, I think we need to combine the tags into one variable as a count of number of practices if we are going to run the model as suggested*

## Counting Number of Practices  

```{r count}
main$prac_tot <- rowSums(main[c(5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13)], na.rm=TRUE)


```


## Examining data to model   

```{r desript}

ggplot(data = main, aes(x = year, y = prac_tot )) +           
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill="cornflowerblue") + 
  facet_grid(~locale) + 
  theme_classic()   

```
